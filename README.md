# Rails Programming

## PROJECT: Private events!

## Introduction

In this project we built a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations and parties (sound familiar?). Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like ‚ÄúAndy‚Äôs House‚Äù).
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).

We used basic concepts of Ruby on Rails including:

- Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Associations
- Views
- RESTful design
- Authentication system
- Adding gems for extra features
